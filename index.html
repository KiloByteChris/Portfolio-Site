						<h3>About</h3>
						<p>My name is Chris McGuire. I am a web development student at Clark College. My plan is to finishing the web development program in spring of 2018. I’m currently searching for an entry level position as a web developer.</p>
                        
						<p>I have been visiting the public library, about once a week, since around 2003. Information access and distribution is one of my main interests. I want to create websites and web based applications that empower people with information</p>

						<p>Here is a website I design and build for the Portland area heavy metal band The Desolate. It was a privilege to create a website around the intense background image and band logo. They asked specifically for a website that presents their entire web presents in one place. The website has every resource a new or established fan would need. It is also fully responsive. My favorite part is the inverted background colors when the menu is displayed. This website is heavy!</p>

						<h3>Guitar</h3>
                        <p>I have been playing the guitar since 2000. There have been several different phases and styles in my playing since I started. For about 5 or 6 years now though, I’ve mostly settled on playing in the style of Chet Atkins, John Fahey, and maybe even Leo Kottke. I particularly like Chet Atkins style because I prefer electric guitars to acoustic guitars. My ambition is to invent a style of guitar playing that incorporate the playing technique of Chet Atkins with the tone of Dick Dale and some afro-beat rhythm influence. For a sample of my music, head to my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MrBrothercactus">YouTube</a> channel.</p>

						<h3>WordPress Blog</h3>
						<p>I have a blog about new music. It's called <a href="http:///www.newvolume.wordpress.com">New Volume</a></p>
                        
                        <p>I know what my favorite band is already. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUngObzy6c" >It’s The Melvins.</a> If I stop there, life will get pretty slow. I’ll get stuck playing the same old records. I’ve decided to get over listening to music as a comfort and start listening for a challenge.</p>
                        
                        <p>Some folks say they “listen to everything”. I prefer to say that I’ll listen to anything. I see musical taste as an exercise in empathy. If I’m not liking a song, it’s because I’m not seeing what the appreciators see. Almost all music has fans of some kind. When I’m able to work at it, and listen with someone else’s ears, there is an opportunity to get into something new.</p>
                        
                        <p>I like to keep up on new music releases using <a href="https://www.allmusic.com/newreleases/all">allmusic.com/newreleases</a>. The list of new album releases updates every Friday. I try to spend 2-3 hours a week sifting through the sounds, looking for anything interesting. It’s never boring.</p>
                        
                        <p>This blog is a curation of what I find in the new releases list. It’s an attempt to listen to a random selection of music. Every song I find goes into a YouTube playlist (unless it’s completely meritless). At the end of the week I share the playlist and write about my favorites. When I find something particularly interesting, I share it on Twitter. The newer the video the better. Nothing over a year old makes the playlist.</p>
