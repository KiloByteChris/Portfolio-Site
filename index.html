I also used to website from other bands that they mentioned for inspiration for the design. This website is my first attempt at a responsive website.</p>

						<h3>Guitar</h3>
						<p>I've been playing guitar since the year 2000. I've played many different styles. For the past five or so years I've been playing electric fingerstyle guitar like Chet Atkins.
						<p>Check out this one: I wrote this song for 12-string guitar tuned to open C minor</p>
						<p>Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MrBrothercactus">YoutTube</a> for more.

					<div id="blog" class="contentDiv">
						<h3>WordPress Blog</h3>
						<p>I have a blog about new music. It's called <a href="http:///www.newvolume.wordpress.com">New Volume</a></p>
                        
                        <p>I know what my favorite band is already. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUngObzy6c" >It’s The Melvins.</a> If I stop there, life will get pretty slow. I’ll get stuck playing the same old records. I’ve decided to get over listening to music as a comfort and start listening for a challenge.</p>
                        
                        <p>Some folks say they “listen to everything”. I prefer to say that I’ll listen to anything. I see musical taste as an exercise in empathy. If I’m not liking a song, it’s because I’m not seeing what the appreciators see. Almost all music has fans of some kind. When I’m able to work at it, and listen with someone else’s ears, there is an opportunity to get into something new.</p>
                        
                        <p>I like to keep up on new music releases using <a href="https://www.allmusic.com/newreleases/all">allmusic.com/newreleases</a>. The list of new album releases updates every Friday. I try to spend 2-3 hours a week sifting through the sounds, looking for anything interesting. It’s never boring</p>
                        
                        <p>This blog is a curation of what I find in the new releases list. It’s an attempt to listen to a random selection of music. Every song I find goes into a YouTube playlist (unless it’s completely meritless). At the end of the week I share the playlist and write about my favorites. When I find something particularly interesting, I share it on Twitter. The newer the video the better. Nothing over a year old makes the playlist.</p>
