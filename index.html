						<h3>Web Development Portfolio</h3>
						<p>Here is a list of projects I've worked on. Right now it looks like the same site three times. That is because it is 1 website 3 times. As I'm able to put more websites together I can add them to the site.</p>
						
						<h4>The Desolate - Website</h4>
						<div class="websiteImageDiv">
							<a href="http://www.theflippedwig.com/home.html"><img class="sampleWebsite" src="img/website_sample_small.jpg" alt="a sample website" /></a>
						</div>
						<p>This website is one i made for a friend's metal band. They didn't have many requirements. I chose to base the site off of the bandcamp site they've already put together for themselves. I also used to website from other bands that they mentioned for inspiration for the design. This website is my first attempt at a responsive website.</p>

						<h3>WordPress Blog</h3>
						<p>I have a blog about new music. It's called <a href="http:///www.newvolume.wordpress.com">"New Volume"</a></p>
						<p>Every week i go to the list of new music releases at allmusic.com. I try to spend 2-3 hours a week looking up new music from the list. I put all the music i find into a YouTube playlist. At the end of the week I publish the playlist. I also write about my favorite stuff from the week.</p>
